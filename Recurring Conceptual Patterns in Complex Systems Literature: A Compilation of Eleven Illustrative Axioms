Abstract
Complex systems across domains exhibit recurring conceptual patterns related to network formation, resource storage, rhythmicity, fractality, and resilience. This note compiles eleven such patterns as illustrative “axioms” drawn from established literature in network science, fractal geometry, information theory, and self-organized criticality. Each axiom is presented with representative citations and qualitative description. The compilation is exploratory and non-exhaustive, intended as a reference for discussion rather than a formal theoretical framework. Links to the open-source tool Fracttalix v2.6.4 are provided for optional empirical exploration of related time-series signatures.

Keywords: complex systems, conceptual patterns, network science, fractal geometry, self-organized criticality

Introduction
Research in complex systems—spanning physics, biology, ecology, sociology, and finance—reveals recurring qualitative patterns in how systems organize, process resources, exhibit dynamics, and respond to perturbation. These patterns are often described in conceptual terms across disciplines.

This note compiles eleven such patterns as illustrative “axioms,” selected for their frequency in the literature. The compilation is interpretive and heuristic: no deductive structure, originality, or empirical validation is claimed beyond alignment with cited sources. The goal is to provide a concise reference for interdisciplinary discussion.

Related univariate time-series metrics (e.g., fractal dimensions, entropy measures) can be explored using the open-source tool Fracttalix v2.6.4 (CC0 license; https://github.com/thomasbrennan/Fracttalix).

Compiled Conceptual Patterns
1.  Matter and energy tend to aggregate into interconnected structures
Representative: Barabási (2016); Song et al. (2005).
Description: Physical and informational interactions drive spontaneous network formation from fundamental scales.

2.  Networks accumulate and store resources to maintain order against dissipation
Representative: West (2017).
Description: Connected systems buffer entropy through storage of energy, matter, or information.

3.  Increasing resource storage capacity enables greater structural and informational complexity
Representative: Grassberger (1989).
Description: Larger storage supports higher intricacy in organization and processing.

4.  Critical connectivity thresholds yield emergent global coordination
Representative: Erdős & Rényi (1960).
Description: Percolation-like transitions produce giant components and coordinated behavior.

5.  Information is conveyed through both spatial structure and temporal dynamics
Representative: Stam (2007); Buzsáki (2006).
Description: Topology (structure) and oscillations (rhythm) encode and transmit signals.

6.  Active functional systems exhibit rhythmic oscillations; disruption reduces rhythmicity
Representative: Buzsáki (2006).
Description: Rhythmicity characterizes functioning; dormancy or damage suppresses it.

7.  Disruption propagates cascades until reorganization restores function
Representative: Bak et al. (1987).
Description: Stress triggers avalanches (self-organized criticality); rhythm often resumes post-cascade.

8.  Many systems display scale-invariant fractal self-similarity
Representative: Mandelbrot (1982); West (2017).
Description: Structural and dynamical patterns repeat across scales.

9.  Systems interconnect across multiple scales and dimensions
Representative: Grinsted et al. (2004).
Description: Lateral, temporal, and fractal coherence links components.

10.  Matched subsystems tend to align oscillations
Representative: Strogatz (2000).
Description: Coupling synchronizes rhythms in compatible units.

11.  Perturbations can lead to breakdown followed by adaptive reorganization
Representative: Holling (1973); Bak et al. (1987).
Description: Stress triggers cascades; resilient systems reorganize at enhanced stability.

Discussion
These patterns recur across literature but vary by domain and scale. Interdependence (e.g., rhythm supporting synchronization) and potential conflicts (e.g., cascades vs. stable rhythm) warrant further exploration. The compilation is selective and qualitative—intended as a starting point for discussion.

Limitations: Non-systematic selection; no quantitative validation; patterns not universal.

Future Directions: Systematic reviews; empirical mapping; integration with time-series tools like Fracttalix.

This note compiles recurring ideas for community consideration.
