## Abstract

This methodological note applies the open-source tool Fracttalix v2.6.3, implementing established monofractal and entropy metrics with phase-randomized surrogates, to synthetic binomial cascades and full 24-hour RR interval recordings from all subjects in PhysioNet Normal Sinus Rhythm (nsrdb, n=18) and Congestive Heart Failure (chfdb, n=15) databases. Synthetic results show expected scaling behavior. Empirical analysis reveals significantly reduced persistence and complexity in CHF vs. healthy subjects (Wilcoxon p=0.001–0.002), consistent with literature on loss of long-range correlations in disease. Fracttalix provides a convenient tool for exploratory monofractal screening of physiological time series.

Keywords: heart rate variability, fractal analysis, entropy metrics, time series screening, complex systems

## Introduction

Reduced long-range correlations and complexity in heart rate variability are associated with pathological states (Peng et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1999). This note applies standard monofractal metrics (Hurst R/S, Higuchi FD, DFA, sample entropy, Petrosian FD; Higuchi, 1988; Peng et al., 1994; Richman & Moorman, 2000; Petrosian, 1995) via Fracttalix to synthetic cascades and full PhysioNet nsrdb/chfdb recordings for exploratory purposes.

## Methods

### Data
- **Synthetic Binomial**: Cascades (4096 points, p=0.6–0.9) for scaling variation.
- **Empirical**: Full 24-hour RR intervals from all 18 nsrdb subjects (5 men aged 26–45, 13 women aged 20–50) and all 15 chfdb subjects (11 men aged 22–71, 4 women aged 54–63). Artifact/ectopic beats filtered using PhysioNet annotations and threshold removal (>20% deviation from local mean).

### Analysis
Fracttalix v2.6.3 with wavelet detrending (db4, level 3; Percival & Walden, 2000). 100 phase-randomized surrogates. Group comparisons via Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

## Results

### Synthetic Binomial Cascade (p=0.75)
- Hurst: 0.78  
- Higuchi FD: 1.32  
- DFA: 1.41 (p=0.01)  
- Sample Entropy: 0.45  
- Petrosian FD: 1.05

### Empirical HRV (Full 24h Recordings, All Subjects)
Healthy (nsrdb, n=18): Hurst 0.82 ± 0.06, DFA 1.41 ± 0.07.  
CHF (chfdb, n=15): Hurst 0.71 ± 0.08, DFA 1.24 ± 0.09.  
Wilcoxon rank-sum: DFA p=0.002, Hurst p=0.001 (significant reduction in CHF).

## Discussion

Fracttalix detects significantly reduced persistence in CHF vs. healthy HRV, consistent with literature on complexity loss in cardiac pathology (Ivanov et al., 1999; Peng et al., 1995).

**Limitations**: Demographics imbalance (healthy younger/female-heavy; CHF older/male-heavy) may confound; no age/sex adjustment performed; monofractal only; tool equivalent to existing libraries.

**Future Work**: Covariate-adjusted cohorts; hybrid with MF-DFA; broader pathological states.

Fracttalix aids exploratory monofractal screening of physiological series.
